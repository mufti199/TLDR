[How To Speak by Patrick Winston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY)

Quality of Speech = function ( Knowledge, Practice, Talent) ⇒ in order of mportance

1. HOW TO START

Do Not start with a Joke. People are still getting used to your speaking/vocal parameters.
Empowerment Promise ⇒ how the talk is of benefit to the audience

2. SAMPLES

It is a good idea to cycle around the subject
Build a "fence" around the idea
Verbal Punctuations
Ask a Question - (Do not wait longer than 7 seconds for an answer)

3. TIME and PLACE

11 am
Well Lit
"Cased" places - inspect the venue. Imagine the Audience
Resonably Populated

4. TRADE TOOLS

Board : Graphic + Speed + Target                         - Good for informing
Props : Point of Interest + Empathetic Mirroring
Slides : Simplify + Large Font + No laser pointer  - Good for presentation

5. INFORMING

Empowerment Promise
Inspiration       - through genuine passion
How to Think   - by understanding stories (through analysis, problem solving, etc.)

6. PERSUADING

Oral Exam      - Failure to situate and practice. Critical review from 3rd parties.
Job Talks        - Vision : Valuable Problem + Innovative Approach/Solution
                       - Previous work
                         ⇒ establish these within 5 minutes!
                       - Contributions

Get Famous   -  Using the 5 S'
    - Symbols associate with your ideas (visual perception is the best way to attract attention
    - Slogan (describing your idea)
    - Surprise (common fallacy that is no longer true, for instance, just after you’ve told about it)
    - Salient Idea (not necessarily important but the one that sticks out)
    - Story (how you did it, how it works…)
7. HOW TO STOP

    - Don’t put collaborators at the end, do that at the beginning.
    - Question’s the worst way to end a talk.
    - End with Contributions
    – to sum up everything you’ve told with your OWN decision.
    - At the very end you could tell a joke
    - Do Not end with "Thank you (for listening)"
    Instead use Quote of a prominent person
    Or Salute the audience ⇒ express how much you value their time
