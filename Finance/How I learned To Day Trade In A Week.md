1. There are two types of investing:
   - Fundamental - Research the company, rivals, market, etc.
   - Analytical - Analyze only the stock data of companies, markets, etc.
2. Day traders use analytical investing to make Day Trades and/or Swing Trades.
   - Day trade - Buy and sell stock on the same day.
   - Swing trade - Buy and sell stock on different days.
3. Day traders trade stocks that have low float and high volume to maximise profits.

   - Float - The amount of stock available for trade (not equivalent to share cap)
   - Volume - The total amount of security traded within a certain period of time.
